  mDialogue:
  - Hello there!
  - Hello?
  - What did you do to end up here?
  - Here? Where is here?
  - You know, I'm not really sure. I've been here as long as I can remember and I'm
    still not sure about a lot of things. Like where we are. Or how I got here.
  - What do you know?
  - Hmm...Well I do know one thing for sure.
  - ...and that is?
  - You can't escape.
  - But the boat?
  - 'Oh that thing? You''re welcome to give it a shot. I gave up long ago. Perfectly
    seaworthy. It''s just...well, you''ll see. Make sure to keep your sail to the
    wind. And watch for cannons. Oh and rocks too. And we''ll just start with those
    for now and see how you fair. '
  - Oh is that all?
  - Fair winds and following seas!
  - '**SET SAIL**'
