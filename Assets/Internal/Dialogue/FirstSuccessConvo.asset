  - Hello there!
  - You again?
  - Were you expecting someone else?
  - Anyone else.
  - Well you got me. At least you survived and got back here in one piece.
  - I'm leaving again.
  - Well alright then, but I'm telling ya from experience, best to just stay here.
    But if you're set on it, good luck out there. Maybe this trip will go even better
