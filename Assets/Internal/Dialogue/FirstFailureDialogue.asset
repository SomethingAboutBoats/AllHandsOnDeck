  - Hello there!
  - I'm alive?
  - Well you washed back up here. I pulled you from the sea, and you've been out
    for a while. It's real dangerous in these waters. Best to stay here on the island.
  - But I need out!
  - Well you're welcome to try again, but I'm telling you, there's no escape.
  - I'll make it!
  - Well watch out this time. Maybe take a lesson from last time and avoid those
    cannons. Anyway, the ship drifted back and I got her all fixed up. Fair winds
    and following seas!
  - '**SET SAIL**'
